# Real-Time-Distance-Monitoring-with-Arduino
This repository contains Python code for real-time distance monitoring using an ultrasonic sensor connected to an Arduino board. The distance data is sent to the computer via serial communication and plotted dynamically using Matplotlib. The program also detects significant changes in mean and variance of the distance readings.
